## Hellooooooo!!!

ðŸŽ“ I'm a Master's student in **Computer Science** with a Bachelor's degree in **Physics**.  

Currently exploring new programming languages and applying coding skills to a variety of playful and fresh projects.

Bringing fresh ideas, enthusiasm, and a strong curiosity to understand how those 0s and 1s work together.

Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and improving through hands on work. I adapt quickly to new challenges and technologies, always driven by a desire to grow and improve.
